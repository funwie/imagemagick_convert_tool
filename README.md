## Image Conversion tool
Uses ImageMagick convert with -resize option to convert input image to output image format with the given filename

#### Expected json schema
See the sample data.json file

#### Run
python main.py file-with-json-data

##### Run the example data.json with the logo.jpeg image
python main.py data.json

#### Remarks
- Testing is missing because of time constraints but i consider testing a critical part of the solution
- This solution does the conversions as expected but it is not a production ready solution.
- We will have to confirm the architecture to use and then refactor the code accordingly
